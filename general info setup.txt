***********************************
installing requirements 
cmd pip3 install flask

if you type in: pip freeze                            you can view what has been installed
To stop the flask app running ctrl+C

Return to VS code; in our py file 

Renamed from test.py to hello.py
from flask import Flask , render_template 
app= Flask(__name__) note it requires two underscores    we are creating a flask instance helps flask find all its files directories 

 To keep flask running in our cmd **********************
#server to run flask properly
# set FLASK_APP=hello.py
# set FLASK_ENV=development
# set FLASK_DEBUG=1 to automatically load after any changes
#flask run

This sectin should always go at the bottom of the flask py file
if __name__ == "__main__":
   app.run(debug=True)

These were all the requirements i used previously: 
from flask import Flask, render_template 
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from datetime import datetime
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm 
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired
from wtforms import StringField, SubmitField
